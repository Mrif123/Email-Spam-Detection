# Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning

Designed a Machine Learning model for prediction of the mails into two categories such as spam or ham(not spam) using the Scikit Learn's Naive Bayes algorithm's MultiNomialNB class implementation and also used the TfidfVectorizer for transforming the train and the text data so that it reduces the chances of obtaining the value errors of type conversions.

Also designed a Streamlit WebApp for predicting the message as a spam or ham mail based on the input message provided by the user using the pickle module of python for creation of the .pkl extension files and embedded it as a model for effective prediction.

The below attached are the glimpses of the prediction using the Streamlit WebApp:
